**My Community is app that aims to make public spending, and HOA's as transparent as possible**

My Community aims to create small blockchains that run on individuals personal
smartphones for communities to manage, the way it works is when individuals
sign up they put in their zipcode or some form of area identifier and then the
app will create a unique form of identifier for the users on the blockchain
if it exists. if the blockchain for that area doesn't exist it will create one.

After a user joins a blockchain they will be expected to make a monthly
contribution to their Communities box. The reason behind the community is to
create in a way a saving account for areas to use.

**Some examples**

1. The local school in the area needs some rooms to be repainted, an individual
   in the community can create something called a 'Story'. He will describe the
   problem and ask the other individuals in the area to vote on releasing some
   funds to help fund the repainting.
2. Their was a natural disaster in the area, and some members in the community
   had to leave their house. Their community can use the funds to help the
   affected individuals.
3. A local road in the area needs to be repaired but the local government
   doesn't have the funds necessary to fund the project. So people in the community
   can vote on releasing some funds to repair the road.
4. A local community can use the money for anything as long as more than 50%
   of the network votes on releasing the funds. communities can start stories
   to start ventures, provide loans and/or improve their local area.

The idea behind My Community is to unify individuals in a certain areas to a
common goal. And since the ledger of transactions exists on everyone's device
it will be very hard to modify the ledger if you do not have more than 50% of
the network.

Other potential ideas is to allow the blockchain to also run on personal
computers to improve the strength of the blockchain network.
