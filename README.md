# myCommunity

A mobile app for connecting Communities together by creating Community Boxes that Individuals can contribute to financially. They can use Community Boxes to fund small-scale projects around their local Community.

The app is using blockchain technology to completely decentralize the Communities so no one Individual can control and manipulate the Data, keeping it consistent and safe. The blockchain will also keep records of votes and all financial transactions.
